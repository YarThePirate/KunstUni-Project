Dear Matt Scola,

thank you for working together with us.
Please find here a record of our talk yesterday.
I will send you the material for programming asap.

// Programming Work 1: exhibition 
one big canvas, draggable in window of the iPad
on click: images open in full-size gallery-view,
on click: video from vimeo open in full-size view
on click: image opens + audio plays

you will receive one big png-file 
plus instructions on what happens on what element


// Programming Work 2: QR-Code Game

// Programming Work 3: 7 dragable icons are pushed by user through open gate of white wall
= moves screen down so user can watch 7 videos from youtube.

see explanation of Programming works explained in PDF (attached)


// Timing
we agreed that you will try to work all three programmings until April 12 (Easter Break)
After April 23 we try to combine your programming with the framework

It would be good, if you made a first little test so we can already see, 
if the programming is harmful to the framework.


// Meeting with programmer
Our programmer wishes to further test the framework before he will let you know exact specifications for your programming environment 



// Naming Scheme
we have to take care about the correct naming of functions and definitions 
the worst case scenario would be, if the naming is mixed up with the framework.
therefore i suggest a naming scheme like this:
firstletter:  h <- stands for horizontal version
second 4 letters: define the name/author of the article 
this means:   
hJahr_functionname   <- javascript-functions for Jahrmann-Article Game
hHart_functionname   <- javascript-functions for Hartl-Article Game
hExhi_functionname   <- javascript-functions for Exhibition-Article

Also take care of the naming scheme for CSS-Definitions and filenames.
