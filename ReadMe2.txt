Dear Matt,
here is the first screen with explanations:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/627gi1mubhqd5g5/LUDICSPACE.zip

the gif animation at the top will be changed.

// Explanations:
• Startscreen 1: click anywhere = fades to screen 2
• onclick: play sound  „StartscreenSelect.mp3“

Screen 2
• icons are positioned randomly (see Script ludicspace-html-demo.zip. Thic can be improved, it is just a start
• if you click on an icons it starts a pulsating animation (pulsAnimation.zip). animation plays only once
• if user clicks on icon, play sound „IconGrab.wav“
• while user holds icon, icons is shown bigger (120%)
• user can move icons within white border, but not outside of white border

Nice-To-Have: if Icons move against wall = the show a bounce-effect

Icons should be put through top space (position of animated gif = arrowUp.gif)
• if icon is moved beyond screen, screen 2 moves downward, screen 3 moves downward (see explanation move)


// Screen 3 
• Text is over Video_preview-Image.
Please insert ?&showinfo=0&controls=0 after URL to hide title and controlbar (does that make sense?)
On click = show control elements (is that possible?)

• click on red arrow to move back to screen 2
• swipe up to move down could be possible also (if that is easy)

• the icon you have shot out of window is now gone.
• if all 7 icons are gon you see a black screen + „Game Over“ in the center.
        play „GameOver.wav“-Sound


Hope this makes all sense
Rest = this night tomorrow very early

thank you
